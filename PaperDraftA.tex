\section{Introduction}
State Universities, Liberal Arts Colleges, and Professional Schools (SLPs)

\subsection{The Local Institute Pyramid}
Research at SLPs is domininated by individual research groups or labs that produce research that is disseminated to their respective fields by means of publications, conferences, etc. The community within the university, and especially the community outside of the school, generally hears very little about the specific work being done at the school unless they happen to be invested enough in the topic to read over publications.
